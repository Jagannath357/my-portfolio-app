                            {/* I'm a passionate full-stack developer with 3+ years of experience creating web applications that solve real-world problems. I love working with modern technologies and am always eager to learn new things. */}
                            I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, and over the past year, I've developed a strong passion for front-end development. I enjoy transforming design concepts into clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
                            I've built several personal projects, including my own portfolio website, a to-do list app, and a personal expense tracker. I also collaborated with a team to redesign a university clubâ€™s website, which helped me strengthen my teamwork and communication skills.
